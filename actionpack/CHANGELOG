*0.7.6*

* Included ERB::Util so all templates can easily escape HTML content with <%=h @person.content %>

* All requests are now considered local by default, so everyone will be exposed to detailed debugging screens on errors.
  When the application is ready to go public, set ActionController::Base.consider_all_requests_local to false, 
  and implement the protected method local_request? in the controller to determine when debugging screens should be shown.

* Fixed three bugs with the url_for/redirect_to/link_to handling. Considering the url http://localhost:81/friends/show/1

    url_for(:action => "list")
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/list/1
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/list
    
    url_for(:controller => "friends", :action => "destroy", :id => 5)
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/destroy
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/destroy/5

  Considering the url http://localhost:81/teachers/show/t

    url_for(:action => "list", :id => 5)
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/5eachers/list/t
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/teachers/list/5
