*0.7.8*

* Fixed session bug where you couldn't store any objects that didn't exist in the standard library 
  (such as Active Record objects).

* Added reset_session method for Action Controller objects to clear out all objects in the session.

* Fixed that exceptions raised during filters are now also caught by the default rescues

* Added new around_filter for doing before and after filtering with a single object [Florian Weber]:

    class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
      around_filter BenchmarkingFilter.new
      
      # Before this action is performed, BenchmarkingFilter#before(controller) is executed
      def index
      end
      # After this action has been performed, BenchmarkingFilter#after(controller) is executed
    end
    
    class BenchmarkingFilter
      def initialize
        @runtime
      end
      
      def before
        start_timer
      end
      
      def after
        stop_timer
        report_result
      end
    end

* Added the options for specifying a different name and id for the form helper methods than what is guessed [Florian Weber]:

    text_field "post", "title"
      ...just gives: <input id="post_title" name="post[title]" size="30" type="text" value="" />
      
    text_field "post", "title", "id" => "title_for_post", "name" => "first_post_title"
      ...can now give: <input id="title_for_post" name="first_post_title" size="30" type="text" value="" />

* Added DebugHelper with a single "debug" method for doing pretty dumps of objects in the view
  (now used in the default rescues to better present the contents of session and template variables)

* Added note to log about the templates rendered within layouts (before just the layout was shown)

* Fixed redirects on https setups [Andreas]

* Fixed scaffolding problem on the edit action when using :suffix => true [Scott]

* Fixed scaffolding problem where implementing list.rhtml wouldn't work for the index action

* URLs generated now uses &amp; instead of just & so pages using it can validate with W3C [Spotted by Andreas]


*0.7.7*

* Fixed bug in CGI extension that prevented multipart forms from working


*0.7.6*

* Included ERB::Util so all templates can easily escape HTML content with <%=h @person.content %>

* All requests are now considered local by default, so everyone will be exposed to detailed debugging screens on errors.
  When the application is ready to go public, set ActionController::Base.consider_all_requests_local to false, 
  and implement the protected method local_request? in the controller to determine when debugging screens should be shown.

* Fixed three bugs with the url_for/redirect_to/link_to handling. Considering the url http://localhost:81/friends/show/1

    url_for(:action => "list")
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/list/1
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/list
    
    url_for(:controller => "friends", :action => "destroy", :id => 5)
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/destroy
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/destroy/5

  Considering the url http://localhost:81/teachers/show/t

    url_for(:action => "list", :id => 5)
      ...used to give http://localhost:81/5eachers/list/t
      ......now gives http://localhost:81/teachers/list/5

* Logs exception to logfile in addition to showing them for local requests

* Protects the eruby load behind a begin/rescue block. eRuby is not required to run ActionController.

* Fixed install.rb to also install clean_logger and the templates

* Added ActiveRecordStore as a session option. Read more in lib/action_controller/session/active_record_store.rb [Tim Bates]

* Change license to MIT License (and included license file in package)

* Application error page now returns status code 500 instead of 200

* Fixed using Procs as layout handlers [Florian Weber]

* Fixed bug with using redirects ports other than 80

* Added index method that calls list on scaffolding


*0.7.5*

* First public release
