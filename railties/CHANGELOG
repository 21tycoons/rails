*0.6.5*

* No longer specifies a template for rdoc, so it'll use whatever is default (you can change it in the rakefile)

* The new_model generator will now use the same rules for plural wordings as Active Record 
  (so Category will give categories, not categorys) [Kevin Radloff]

* dispatch.fcgi now sets FCGI_PURE_RUBY to true to ensure that it's the Ruby version that's loaded [danp]

* Made the GEM work with Windows

* Fixed bug where mod_ruby would "forget" the load paths added when switching between controllers

* PostgreSQL are now supported for the automated production => test database dropping [Kevin Radloff]

* Errors thrown by the dispatcher are now properly handled in FCGI.

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.8.0 (lots and lots and lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.4 (a bunch of fixes)


*0.6.0*

* Added AbstractionApplicationController as a superclass for all controllers generated. This class can be used
  to carry filters and methods that are to be shared by all. It has an accompanying ApplicationHelper that all
  controllers will also automatically have available.

* Added environments that can be included from any script to get the full Active Record and Action Controller
  context running. This can be used by maintenance scripts or to interact with the model through IRB. Example:
  
    require 'config/environments/production'
    
    for account in Account.find_all
      account.recalculate_interests
    end
  
  A short migration script for an account model that had it's interest calculation strategy changed.

* Accessing the index of a controller with "/weblog" will now redirect to "/weblog/" (only on Apache, not WEBrick)

* Simplified the default Apache config so even remote requests are served off CGI as a default.
  You'll now have to do something specific to activate mod_ruby and FCGI (like using the force urls).
  This should make it easier for new comers that start on an external server.

* Added more of the necessary Apache options to .htaccess to make it easier to setup

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.9 (lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.3 (lots of fixes)


*0.5.7*

* Fixed bug in the WEBrick dispatcher that prevented it from getting parameters from the URL
  (through GET requests or otherwise)

* Added lib in root as a place to store app specific libraries

* Added lib and vendor to load_path, so anything store within can be loaded directly. 
  Hence lib/redcloth.rb can be loaded with require "redcloth"

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.8 (lots of fixes)

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.2 (minor upgrade)


*0.5.6*

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.7 (multipart form fix)

* Updated the generated template stubs to valid XHTML files

* Ensure that controllers generated are capitalized, so "new_controller TodoLists" 
  gives the same as "new_controller Todolists" and "new_controller todolists".


*0.5.5*

* Works on Windows out of the box! (Dropped symlinks)

* Added webrick dispatcher: Try "ruby public/dispatch.servlet --help" [Florian Gross]

* Report errors about initialization to browser (instead of attempting to use uninitialized logger)

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.6

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.1

* Added distinct 500.html instead of reusing 404.html

* Added MIT license


*0.5.0*

* First public release
