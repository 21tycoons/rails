*0.5.7*

* Fixed bug in the WEBrick dispatcher that prevented it from getting parameters from the URL
  (through GET requests or otherwise)

* Added lib in root as a place to store app specific libraries

* Added lib and vendor to load_path, so anything store within can be loaded directly. 
  Hence lib/redcloth.rb can be loaded with require "redcloth"

* Upgraded to Active Record 0.9.2 (minor upgrade)


*0.5.6*

* Upgraded to Action Pack 0.7.7 (multipart form fix)
